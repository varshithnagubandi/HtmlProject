<td><p>H C Verma s Concepts Of Physics is an all-inclusive book, which serves to detail out the ABC of physics in an intricate manner making it an ideal book for not only the higher secondary students, but also for those who are preparing for their competitive examinations.Physics as a subject is vast and to have all the concepts of Physics compiled in one book is indeed a boon to all students. The book has been tailored to meet the needs 10 + 2 or higher secondary students and for the students who are appearing for a competitive examination. It has everything a student would possibly need for their success in exams. The book comes supplemented with a large number of solved and unsolved problems. Numerical exercises inundate the book for a better understanding of the subject. The book starts with an Introduction to Physics and goes on to elucidate the concept of Physics and Mathematics in the second chapter. In the third chapter the author talks about Rest and Motion: Kinematics. In the fourth chapter he moves on to discuss the concept of Forces. Newton s Laws of Motion is elaborated in the fifth chapter and the theory of Friction is expanded in the sixth chapter. The seventh and eighth chapters feature discussion on Circular Motion and Work and Energy while the focus of the tenth chapter is on Rotational Mechanics. The details of Gravitation, Simple Harmonic Motion and Fluid Mechanics are developed in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth chapters. The fourteenth and fifteenth chapters explain Some Mechanical Properties of Matter and Wave Motion and Waves on a String. The sixteenth and seventeenth chapters focus on Sound Waves and Light Waves while the eighteenth chapter stresses on the Geometrical Optics. The nineteenth chapter elaborates on Optical Instruments and Dispersion and Spectra, Speed of Light and Photo metry is discussed in the twentieth, twenty-first and twenty-second chapter.</p></td>
<td><p>Concepts of Physics explains the different theories and concepts in an easy-to-understand way, making it popular among students. H. C. Verma s book is an all-inclusive theoretical and conceptual guide that covers a vast range of topics. It is an ideal book not only for pre-college students but also for those appearing for competitive exams in the field of engineering and medicine. It is a book that aims to comprehensively guide the students in various aspects of physics thus, making them fully equipped to answer any type of questions that may come in the exams. Volume 2 of the Concepts of Physics starts with a chapter on Heat and Temperature. It moves on to explain the Kinetic Theory of Gases. The concepts of Calorimetry, Law of Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, Specific Heat Capacities of Gases are discussed in the subsequent chapters. There are separate chapters on Gauss s Law, Electric Field and Potential, and Capacitors. The book also features chapters and detailed explanations on Electric Current in Conductors, Thermal and Chemical effects of Electric Current, and Magnetic Field. The author also elucidates on the concept of Permanent Magnets, Electromagnetic Induction and Electromagnetic Waves. He further stresses on the Magnetic Field due to a current, Magnetic Properties of Matter, Alternating Current and Electric Current through Gases. In the last chapters of the book, the author details out on Bohr s Model and Physics of the Atom, Photoelectric Effect and Wave Particle Duality, X-rays, The Nucleus, Theory of Relativity and, Semiconductors and Semiconductor Devices. Each chapter has been intricately dealt with in the book. It is an ideal study book for all kinds of competitive exams like IIT-JEE and different types of state level exams for engineering and medicine.</p></td>
